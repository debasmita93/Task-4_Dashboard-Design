# Task-4_Dashboard-Design
This is a dataset taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/superstore-sales), which talks about the sales data in a superstore. I had performed data visualization by creating an interactive dashboard the reporting all the key performance indicators (KPIs) using Power BI. It reports all the business decisions and financial transactions with the stakeholders.
